# PYGENUS

## A free open source minimalist physic engine library

My goal for this is to have a physic engine that can run with no dependancy.  
This makes it less easy to use but I think it's a cool challenge.  

Moreover, I would like this to be a complete physic engine with different integration methods,  
that could be use fror easy projects to more advanced simulation.  

In particular, I would like to add things such as:  

1. Fields
1. Object decoratos 
1. Advanced triggers
1. And much more..
